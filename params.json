While this project is a fork of a LaTeX style, that style has not really been used because it could not be made to work with knitR. The significant new content is the coursework itself which has mostly been written by Angus Wallace and Julian Taylor with help from Nathan Watson-Haigh.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nThe contents of this repository are released under the Creative Commons\r\nAttribution 3.0 Unported License.
